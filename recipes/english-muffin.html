    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An English muffin is a versatile breakfast bread known for its slightly crispy exterior and soft, chewy interior.
        It's typically round in shape, with a slightly cratered surface that's perfect for trapping melted butter or
        jam. Made from a yeast-based dough, English muffins are usually split open with a fork rather than sliced,
        resulting in a rustic texture that's ideal for toasting. They boast a delightful balance of tanginess and subtle
        sweetness, making them a beloved choice for morning meals or as a base for sandwiches any time of day.</p>
